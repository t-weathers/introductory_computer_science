# introductory_computer_science
This Repository contains the lab, and assignment work from my introductory computer science class series at Oregon State University, which spanned two classes from Winter to Spring 2018. 
Each folder contains different projects, which will each have their own README.md file to explain the assignment, and guidelines for its development. 
All assignment prompts are from the Oregon State University Curriculum.
The assignments in these folders began with understanding Object Oriented Programming in C++, and move to deeper concepts such as objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and data structures. 
The only exception to the following programs being in C++ is in the second term file, where we began to learn the basic syntax of C, and implement some data structures and sorting algorithms in C.
